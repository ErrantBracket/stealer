This is an attempt to re-write a recent project built with Node.js and Mongo in Golang. 
The subject of the project has changed but I have aimed to keep the same structure. 


The project is intended as a note taker (hence the name) allowing notes to be added to
a subject, inspired by OneNote. The long-term aim is to allow reminders to be added to notes 
and the linking of keywords between different subjects.
